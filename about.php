            <span class="about__lore-subtitle">Arvine is like a great bottle of wine - lovingly created and carefully aged. The longer you spend contemplating its rich hues, the better it gets.</span>
            <span class="about__lore-subtitle">It’s fitting that this region is located between undulating hills and two most famous Russian seas. </span>
            <span class="about__lore-subtitle">Stay in the charming city of Krym, just a short drive from center of the city, you will find wineries with our factory wineshop. Alternatively, if you want to escape the tourists, you could try the Arvine history wine trail or walk by coastal vineyards. </span>
            <span class="about__lore-subtitle">A Arvine wine tour is not a five-minute tasting at a roadside wine bar. It’s an immersive experience into the region’s fabric and history, from the ruins of medieval churches to landscapes that inspired popular Russian poets. </span>
